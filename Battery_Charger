This circuit demonstrates a simple low-current battery charger using the BC547 NPN transistor as a switching and current-limiting element. 
It is suitable for charging small rechargeable batteries (e.g., NiMH or low-capacity Li-ion with external protection). 
The design uses a resistor network to control base current and limit charging current. 
This project is intended for educational purposes and basic understanding of transistor-based charging circuits.
